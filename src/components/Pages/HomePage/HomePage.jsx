            Add a blur or an official Discord preset background to your video
            calls. And, if you have Nitro, upload a custom video background.

            <span className="features__title">New video preview toggle.</span>{" "}
            You can now preview your camera before you go on video. Visit User
            Settings Voice, Video to turn this feature on/off, but leave it on
            if you keep your laundry on that one chair behind you.

              Add bots directly from bot profiles.

            Bot developers can now enable an "Add to Server" button on a bot's
            user profile, so people can add it to their own servers way more
            easily.

              Improvements to GIF cropper.
            </span>{" "}
            It's now faster and smoother to crop GIFs for avatars and profile
            banners. Also, we fine-tuned the cancel button. And by fine-tuned we
            mean it actually works now.

              New server time-out function.{" "}
            </span>
            Moderators and admins of a server can now temporarily prevent a user
            from interacting to help curb disruptive behavior. Also known as the
            “yo dude stop you’re being really weird.” button.

              You can now directly report spam.{" "}
            </span>
            Added a prominent Report Spam button in DMs so you can give us a
            faster signal when you’re being bothered. Also added a Roast Spam
            button for a faster way to make musubi.

              Beefed up our suspicious link warning.{" "}
            </span>
            This new system can also better warn you before you visit a
            malicious domain. Don't click suspicious links. Free Nitro for your
            login information is a lie. Discord employees don’t want your
            password. We can barely remember our own.
